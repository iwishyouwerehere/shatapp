I would really appreciate any kind of help making this project great, or just advice me over mistakes or similar.

What shat needs is client side encryption for messages being send. 
Since every client has a private personal key I thought about encrypting this key with itself, so to generate a special public key everyone can see but no one can decrypt (except for who has the same personal private key).
